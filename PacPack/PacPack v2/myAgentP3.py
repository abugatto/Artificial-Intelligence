    This method handles the initial setup of the
    agent to populate useful fields (such as what team
    we're on).

    A distanceCalculator instance caches the maze distances
    between each pair of positions, so your agents can use:
    self.distancer.getDistance(p1, p2)

    IMPORTANT: This method may run for at most 15 seconds.
